# ðŸš¦ Smart City Traffic Volume Forecasting

This project is part of a 4-week internship where I developed a machine learning pipeline to predict hourly traffic volumes at different city junctions. The goal was to assist smart infrastructure planning using real-time and historical traffic data.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Forecast hourly vehicle flow at junctions using historical traffic data to help city authorities plan and manage traffic effectively.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Train: `train_aWnotuB.csv` (48,120 rows)
- Test: `datasets_8494_11879_test_BdBKkAj.csv`

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- LightGBM, XGBoost
- scikit-learn

## ðŸ“Š Features Engineered
- Hour, Day, Weekday, Month, Year
- Is_Weekend, Is_Night
- Sine and Cosine transformation of Hour and Month for cyclic behavior

## ðŸ“ˆ EDA Highlights
- Hourly traffic trends per junction
- Weekend vs Weekday vehicle counts
- Monthly traffic distribution

## ðŸ§  Models Used
1. **LightGBM Regressor** (Best performance)
2. XGBoost Regressor

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics
- MAE: 2.40
- RMSE: 3.84
- RÂ² Score: 0.96

## ðŸ“¤ Final Output
Predicted traffic volume (`Vehicles`) for the test data saved as `submission.csv`.
